This directory contains the implementation of a lambda calculus reducer

The lambda calculus reducer is a CGI script that permits evaluation of
untyped lambda expressions in a WWW browser.  The CGI scripts are
written in Moscow ML; see http://www.itu.dk/people/sestoft/mosml.html

The implementation has been updated to use the Msp structure from
Moscow ML 2.00 and later.

The lambda calculus reducer is described in:
